Time complexity:
A amount of time runing the program and execution of program is called time complexity.
Space complexity:
A amount of memory , memeory is use to store program. Size of memory is called space ccomplexity.
Represent Complexity:
Mathematicals tools to represent time and space complexity.
1: Big-O Notations (o-Notations) -worst case complexity.(v.vimp)
2: Omega Notations:-Best case complexity.
3: Theta Notations: Average case complexity.
